## Before you do anything
Understand and be comfortable with these things:
- The risks and benefits of portfolio concentration.
- How M1 automated investing works.
- How Morningstar analyzes and rates companies.

## What you need to get started
- Money to invest. (minimum 3-year time horizon, preferably 5; regular contributions)
- Investment account. (I recommend M1 because of the automation, but you could also use Schwab or other discount brokers.)
- Morningstar analyst reports and/or stock screeners. (This may be available through your library or discount broker. I will also post the results of the screen I run on a regular basis.)

## How does the system work?


### The basic steps
1. Run the 3M screen.
2. Adjust pie slices.
3. Enjoy life.
4. Repeat steps 1–3 quarterly.
5. Reset pie annually.


### 2. Adjust pie slices.
This assumes you're holding about 20 companies in your pie.

When buying new companies:
- If the star rating is 5, set the pie slice percentage to 5.
- If the star rating is 4, set the pie slice percentage to 4.

When adjusting existing companies:
- Set the pie slices to the corresponding star rating. (For example, if company changes from 4 stars to 3 stars after a quarterly update, change the company slice to 3%.)
- To get to 100% more easily, you may want to add a "cash" slice to handle extra space in the pie. I use SCHO.

### 4. Repeat steps 1–3 quarterly.
- The typical end dates for fiscal quarters are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
- Companies will typically release quarterly earnings within a month after these dates.
- Don't worry about the specific date too much, but keep in mind that 
- I aim to make adjustments between 2 and 3 weeks after end of quarter dates. (For example, I'll make adjustments after Q3 between 10/15 and 10/31.)
