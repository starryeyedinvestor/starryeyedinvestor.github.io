## Before you do anything
Understand and be comfortable with these things:
- [The pros and cons of portfolio concentration](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/concentrated-vs-diversified-portfolios-comparing-pros-and-cons.asp).
- [How M1 automated investing works](https://support.m1finance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001379367-How-M1-Finance-Trades).
- [How Morningstar analyzes and rates companies](https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/shared/research/methodology/705988Morningstar_Equity_Research_Methodology.pdf). (PDF)

## What you need to get started
- Money to invest. (minimum 3-year time horizon, preferably 5; regular contributions)
- Investment account. (I recommend M1 because of the automation, but you could also use Schwab or other discount brokers.)
- Morningstar analyst reports and/or stock screeners. (This may be available through your library or discount broker. I will also post the results of the screen I run on a regular basis.)

## How does the system work?

### The basic steps
1. Run the 3M screen.
2. Adjust pie slices.
3. Enjoy life.
4. Repeat steps 1–3 quarterly.
5. Reset pie annually.

### 1. Run the 3M screen.
This is the screen using Morningstar analyst data. I also limit the results to U.S. companies, but you can optionally include international/ADR companies as well.

- Morningstar Rating (Margin): 4 or 5 stars
- Morningstar Stewardship (Management): Exemplary
- Morningstar Moat: Narrow or wide

### 2. Adjust pie slices.
This assumes you're holding about 20 companies in your pie.

When buying new companies:
- If the star rating is 5, set the pie slice percentage to 5.
- If the star rating is 4, set the pie slice percentage to 4.

When adjusting existing companies:
- Set the pie slices to the corresponding star rating. (For example, if company changes from 4 stars to 3 stars after a quarterly update, change the company slice to 3%.)
- To get to 100% more easily, you may want to add a "cash" slice to handle extra space in the pie. I use SCHO.

### 3. Enjoy life.
- Take a deep breath and relax.
- Don't look at stock quotes everyday.
- Don't check your portfolio more than once a week.
- Don't worry about day-to-day market moves or financial moves.
- Don't get news or "trade" alerts on your phone.

### 4. Repeat steps 1–3 quarterly.
- The typical end dates for fiscal quarters are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
- Companies will typically release quarterly earnings within a month after these dates.
- Don't worry about the specific date too much, but keep in mind that 
- I aim to make adjustments between 2 and 3 weeks after end of quarter dates. (For example, I'll make adjustments after Q3 between 10/15 and 10/31.)

### 5. Reset pie annually.
