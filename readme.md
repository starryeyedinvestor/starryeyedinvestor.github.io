## The 3 Ms: a hierarchy of value investor needs
1. Margin of safety: the foundation. If you don't have this, nothing else matters.
2. Management: the jockey. You can buy at a good price, but you need people who know what they're doing to unlock value.
3. Moat: the edge. All competitive advantages fade over time, but some last longer than others.

## Who is this for?
This system is designed for astute investors who meet the following criteria:
- You know who Charlie Munger is, but you also know that you are not Charlie Munger (or his better known partner).
- You know what discounted cash flows and operating earnings are, but you're not interested in calculating them on a regular basis.
- You're interested in learning about businesses and reading concise, well-articulated analyses but not 10-K filings.
- You understand the concepts of value investing and mean reversion, but you don't want to turn your portfolio over to a black box algorithm.




## Quotes
- "I'm a lover, not a proxy fighter."
- Comfortable with concentration.
