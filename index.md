## Principles
- Quality on sale.
- Don't think too much.
- Buy regularly.
- Sell occasionally.
- Automate everything.

## The 3 Ms: a hierarchy of value investor needs
1. Margin of safety: the foundation. If you don't have this, nothing else matters.
2. Management: the jockey. You can buy at a good price, but you need people who know what they're doing to unlock value.
3. Moat: the edge. All competitive advantages fade over time, but some last longer than others.

## Who is this for?
This system is designed for me, based on my knowledge, experience, and values. You might be interested or curious if youâ€¦
- Know who Charlie Munger is, but also know you aren't Charlie Munger (or his better known partner).
- Know what discounted cash flows and operating earnings are, but aren't interested in calculating them on a regular basis.
- Love learning about businesses and reading concise, well-articulated analyses (or even books) but not 10-K filings.
- Understand the concepts of value investing and mean reversion, but don't want to turn your portfolio over to a black box algorithm.
