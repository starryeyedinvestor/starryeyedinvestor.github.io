title: "2020 Q4: Baking the pie"
layout: index
---

This is the beginning. This post documents my starting point for this strategy.

The table below is exactly what the 3M Screen returned using the Schwab stock screener on 10/16/2020.

I set up the [Starry-eyed pie](https://m1.finance/uHXwlSY9Rtrq) in my [M1 Finance account](https://m1.finance/m19w_pCEnCTe) (referral link) and funded the account.

As per [step 3]({{site.baseurl}}/steps.html#3-enjoy-life), I will not be checking or reporting on the progress of this investment frequently.

My next scheduled pie adjustment will be around January 15, 2021 and my next post will be on or around February 1, 2021.

## Screen results
The 3Ms column is a combined coding of the margin of safety (4 or 5 stars), management (all exemplary), and moat (narrow or wide). For example, 4EN means 4-star rating, exemplary management, and narrow moat.
